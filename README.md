Hi! I'm UMI ARIFAH BASRI, a student in the Software Maintenance
and Evolution course.
I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance
practices and how to work with legacy systems.
- **Fun fact**: I love to be active like playing badminton, volleyball or jogging/briskwalk.
- **Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in
maintaining and evolving software.
